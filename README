  Node-Expresso is a fork of the popular coffee-script project by @jashkenas.

  It provides a coffee-script console that is meant to be run from within
  your Express project file structure.  It auto requires all modules needed
  for that express application. And it also finds all inline documentation for
  the methods.

  Installing:
  > npm install -g node-expresso

  Running the command line:
  > cd ~/myExpressProjectRoute
  > expresso

  Expresso will now load all the required files and for any which it can not load
  it will print them out.  From here you have a coffee console at your disposal.

  ```
  expressCoffee> console.log "Hello World"
  ```

  For modules which it has auto required, Expresso attempts to find inline documentation
  for them and you can use a built-in 'man' command to see it.

  ```
  expressCoffee> man userRepo.createNewUser
  Usage:
  userRep.createNewUser (first, last, age)
  This method creates a new user and stores them in the database.  It returns back
  the user id of the newly created user.
  Inputs:
     String: first - the first name
     String: last - the last name
     age: int - the users age
  ```

  Expresso is a continuing work in progress, so not all node Express applications
  may work 100% with the current functionality.  And, it assumes you have a /server
  folder in your Express project.
